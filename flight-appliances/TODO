If we're an appliance:

When a member joins the cluster, check:

- is it a master
- does it have a storage role set
- if it does create(/add?) configuration to use that host as an ASMD auth endpoint


For appliance:

Pull in serviceware tarball for alces-storage-manager, e.g.

mkdir -p /opt/clusterware/var/lib/services/repos/appliance
cd /opt/clusterware/var/lib/services/repos/appliance
curl ... | tar xz
al ser inst appliance/alces-storage-manager
# grabs and installs ASM from github
# create appropriate config.yml file in /opt/clusterware/etc/config.yml
